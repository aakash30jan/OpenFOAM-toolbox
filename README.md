# OpenFOAM-toolbox
This toolbox will let you use some basic functions of OpenFOAM in Scilab.

This toolbox contains static executables for different OpenFOAM utilities (currently pimpleFoam solver and simpleFoam solver are available but more coming soon :p). 

## HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN

Clone from either of the following commands :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aashay201297/OpenFOAM-toolbox.git
```
```
$ git clone git@git.forge.scilab.org:openfoam.git
```

You can also look into these scripts to see how the solver is called.

Any suggestions or comments are most welcome. Drop me a mail anytime and I will try to respond to your query as soon as possible.
